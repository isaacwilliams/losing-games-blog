The deep forests, caves and ruins. Minor gods dot the Gloaming Lands. Each  settlement  will have a shrine and practice rituals to appease their local spirit and keep it at bay. Some gods have sympathy for the plight of man. Some are hostile. Most are ambivalent, concerned only with the preservation of their own power. The further away… <br /><br /> <a href="https://losing.games/2018-12-12-gods/">Read full article...</a>]]></description><link>https://losing.games/2018-12-12-gods/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://losing.games/2018-12-12-gods/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 09:22:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gloaming Lands 2: Settlements]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Gloaming Lands are a place deeply etched with disaster. It is (like  many OSR settings ) a post apocalyptic setting. The cycle of civilisation and destruction creates room for mystery and adventure that can be easily understood (and exploited) by players. It is, however, not a bleak, picked-over post-apocalypse. The last true disaster is now but a distant story kept alive by the lorespeakers… <br /><br /> <a href="https://losing.games/2018-12-10-settlements/">Read full article...</a>]]></description><link>https://losing.games/2018-12-10-settlements/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://losing.games/2018-12-10-settlements/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 02:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gloaming Lands 1: Mundane Animals]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the Gloaming Lands, no animal is truly mundane. For the most part they look and smell and behave as you would expect, acting as the background detail for an adventure setting. But each has twist, sometimes obvious, sometimes secret. Normal animals, but if the half-forgotten folk-tale about them was true. The list takes a lot of inspiration from Arnold K's  mundane animals . The goals are… <br /><br /> <a href="https://losing.games/2018-12-6-animals/">Read full article...</a>]]></description><link>https://losing.games/2018-12-6-animals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://losing.games/2018-12-6-animals/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2018 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[100 Special Arrows]]></title><description><![CDATA[These are special arrows — minor magical or mechanical items that give bow-wielding characters a tactical edge. They are written with Knave in mind, but should work for the OSR game of your choice. Special arrows do the same damage as the bow they are fired from, plus any additional effects. Each arrow is good for one successful hit (unless it seems obvious that it should be otherwise).

This generator will create a plethora of goofy-looking characters. The generation method is fairly unsophisticated. no real attempt is made to stop the various layers from being misaligned. Most of the time it'll work, with a bit of imagination.

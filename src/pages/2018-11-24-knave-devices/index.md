Devices are ancient artefacts that possess great power. They act as spells, providing the wielder with extraordinary abilities. Devices are partly alive.

## Device Tier

Devices have a tier of 1-4. This is the device’s base level of power.

## Using a Device

Devices have an ability, which relies on charges. A Device has a base number of Charge Dice equal to its tier, and you roll these when you use the device. The more dice rolled, the more powerful the effect.

When you use a Device, roll a number of d6’s equal to the Device’s current Charge Dice. The ability of the device will depend on the number of [dice] and/or [sum] of values rolled.

Charge Dice rolled with a value of 1-3 are returned to the the Device’s charge pool and can be re-used. Dice of value 4-6 are expended, and don’t return to the device until it is recharged.

## Recharging a device

To recharge a Device, expend a charge cell. This resets the Device’s Charge Dice to equal its tier, and takes a number of hours equal to its tier.

### Overcharging

When you charge a Device you may spend additional charge cells, one for one, to add **Overcharge Dice** to the Device. These count as extra Charge Dice the next time the Device is used, but are always expended (roll separately or use a different colour from regular charge dice).

## Device safety

A Device can only be safely wielded by a user of equal or greater level than the Device’s tier.

If you use a device of greater tier than your level, roll **danger dice** equal to the difference between the values. These do not count towards the device’s effect, but count towards doubles or triples rolled for mishaps and disasters.

> Example: Rolf, a level 1 character, attempts to use a tier two **Pusher**. He rolls two **charge dice** and one **danger die**. The charge dice come up 5 & 3, and a 3 is rolled on the danger die, for a total [sum] of 8 and [dice] of 2. The 3 returns to the device’s charge pool and the 5 is expended. The device also has a Mishap, so Rolf rolls for that before resolving the devices effect.

## Mishaps and disasters

When you roll doubles when using a device, it causes a Mishap. When triples (or more) are rolled, it causes a Disaster. Roll on the mishap or disaster tables for the effect.

### Mishaps

1. All of the Device’s charges are expended
2. Wielder takes 1d6 damage
3. Wielder takes a random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Saves. Permanent if failed.
4. Device effects another random target within range
5. Device is damaged. Cannot be used again until repaired (takes 1d6 hours).
6. Device overcharges. For each 1-3 rolled, roll an additional charge die, and add to the devices effect (additional doubles/triples count towards mishaps/disasters). Then expend all device charges.

### Disasters

1. Device explodes, causing [device tier]d6 damage to all within 10’
2. Device is badly damaged. Can only be repaired using the parts of another Device.
3. Device causes a reverse effect. Double any  The GM should interpret this maliciously.
4. Wielder takes 1d6 random permanent mutations. Save for half.

## Increasing a Device’s tier

A Device’s tier can be increased by using the parts of another Device of equal or greater tier. This destroys the deconstructed device and increases the upgraded device's tier by one.

The process of upgrading a device takes a number of weeks equal to the device’s new tier. (ie, increasing a device from tier 1 to 2 takes two weeks, from 2 to 3 takes three weeks).

# Random Devices

## Device tier

When rolling a random device, roll a d12 for its tier.

| d12   | Device tier
|-------|--------------------
| 1     | Tier 0 - has a single charge which is always depleted when used
| 2-6   | Tier 1
| 7-9   | Tier 2

## Settlements

The Southern Lands are a wild place, and the peoples that populate it keep to the safety of their settlements. Most people will never travel further than the next two or three villages along. Wanderers are looked upon with distrust.

    "Size": "Farm/manor – 1-3 families|Crossroads – 3-4 families|Hamlet – 50-150 people|Village – 150-300 people|Town – 300-1000 people|City – 1000+ people",

## Gods

Minor spirits dot the Southern Lands, and each settlement will have a shrine to their local god. Gods can be fickle creatures, so appeasing them through ritual is important.

The Gloaming Lands are a place deeply etched with disaster. It is (like [many OSR settings](http://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/09/osr-aesthetics-of-ruin.html)) a post apocalyptic setting. The cycle of civilisation and destruction creates room for mystery and adventure that can be easily understood (and exploited) by players.

It is, however, not a bleak, picked-over post-apocalypse. The last true disaster is now but a distant story kept alive by the lorespeakers. Lush forests grow between massive shards nuclear-frozen glass. Herds of deer drink from clear crater lakes. Peoples dot the land, working away in the safety of their settlements.

These tables provide a set of tools for creating those settlements. The settlements themselves are lightly detailed, hopefully providing the GM and players with just enough to describe a location and hint at a hook or two.

A future post will detail a quick procedure for generating a pointcrawl between settlements.

## Settlement tables

### Settlement size

Roll 2d6 and take the lowest value.

[Very few](https://anydice.com/program/c91) settlements are larger than a few hundred people. Smaller settlements pay dues to—and are protected by—a baron or nearby city. Cities are often large enough to support their own standing milita, and some even buy full independence from the system of baronial rent.

<div data-table-marker="sizes"></div>

| d6  | Size    
|-----|---------------
| 1   | Farm/manor – 1-3 families
| 2   | Crossroads – 3-5 families
| 3   | Hamlet – 50-150 people
| 4   | Village – 150-300 people
| 5   | Town – 300-1000 people
| 6   | City – 1000+ people

### Settlement details

For all settlements, Roll 1d20 for each column.

- **Towns:** Roll an additional time on either the **Building**, **Industry** or **Event** column.
- **Cities:** Roll an additional time on each of the **Building**, **Industry** and **Event** columns.

### Settlement names

Roll d10 for the structure of the name, then a d20 for each column indicated by the structure. Names will probably need a bit of massaging for mouthfeel.

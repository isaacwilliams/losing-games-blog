Want a portrait for the random NPC you just rolled up? This generator will create a plethora of goofy-looking characters.

The generation method is fairly unsophisticated. no real attempt is made to stop the various layers from being misaligned. Most of the time it'll work, with a bit of imagination.

Play around with the the sliders for a wider range of unnatural skin colors or a more subdued palette for the clothing and hair. Use the fill style to create more print-friendly black-and-white portraits for handouts.

Gods are the rulers of the places between where men dwell. The deep forests, caves and ruins.

Minor gods dot the Gloaming Lands. Each [settlement](/2018-12-10-settlements) will have a shrine and practice rituals to appease their local spirit and keep it at bay. Some gods have sympathy for the plight of man. Some are hostile. Most are ambivalent. They are concerned with the preservation of their own power.

## Table of Gods

### God Power

Roll 3d6 for a god's HD.

The HD of a god defines several things about it â€” it's power to act, the size it presents itself to people, and the level of devotion it expects from the people within its realm.

Stat a god as a magic user of level equivalent to it's HD.

| HD    | Physical size | Rituals                              | Shrines                           |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 3     | Dog           | Annual bacchanal                     | Ruined or forgotten               |
| 4-5   | Man           | Seasonal festivals                   | Poorly maintained                 |
| 6-8   | Bear          | Timed with cycles of the moon        | Small, not notable                |
| 9-12  | Wagon         | Weekly rituals                       | Well maintained                   |
| 13-15 | House         | Daily rituals                        | Large and ornate                  |
| 16-17 | Castle        | Deeply ingrained into everyday life  | On every corner                   |
| 18    | Mountain      | Unceasing rituals                    | Settlements are just huge shrines |

## Example gods

### Fuun, who keeps the stars

**Power:** 12 HD  
**Attitude:** Friendly  
**Domain:** Sky, Stars  
**Form:** Deer, shaped by domain  
**Ritual:** Consecration  
**Ritual focus:** Water  

**Fuun, who keeps the stars** appears as a deer as big as a wagon, with a shimmering night-black pelt and antlers that fizz and spit like a shooting star caught in mid-flight.

The people within the realm of **Fuun** hold weekly rituals, at midnight on the seventh day, in well-maintained shrines at the forest's edge.

Each shrine contains a large, still pool of holy water, which is filled fresh from the river and consecrated with sacred smoke. The people watch in silence as **Fuun** drinks from the holy pool. In return for their devotion, the people are blessed with the ability to read the stars with great accuracy, and are renowned for their abilities as fortune tellers.

### Kree-ook, devourer of all

**Power:** 9 HD  
**Attitude:** Hostile  
**Domain:** Food, Fertility  
**Form:** Frog, twisted proportions  
**Ritual:** Acquisition  
**Ritual focus:** Liquor  

**Kree-ook, devourer of all** appears as a massive drunken frog, as big as a cart. His tongue is ridiculously long, and he keeps it wrapped around his body like a scarf.

The shrines within **Kree-ook's** realm resemble beautiful, ornate, loading docks, built all around at the edges of White Monkey Lake. Every week the people of the realm bring forth vast quantities of rice wine and roll the bottles down into the lake.

If the people fail to bring **Kree-ook** the wine he demands, plagues of frogs ascend from the lake, destroying crops in their wake.

Gods are the rulers of the places between where men dwell. The deep forests, caves and ruins.

Minor gods dot the Gloaming Lands. Each [settlement](/2018-12-10-settlements) will have a shrine and practice rituals to appease their local spirit and keep it at bay. Some gods have sympathy for the plight of man. Some are hostile. Most are ambivalent. They are concerned with the preservation of their own power.

## Table of Gods

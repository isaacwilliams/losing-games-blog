In the Southern Lands, no animal is truly mundane. For the most part they look and smell and behave as you would expect, acting as the background detail for an adventure setting. Normal animals, but if the half-forgotten folk-tale about them was true.

The list takes a lot of inspiration from Arnold K's [mundane animals](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-secrets-of-mundane-animals.html). The goals are similar but not identical. This list exists for several purposes:

- Create a snapshot of an ecology. If you need an animal in the Southern Lands, pick or roll on this table.
- Convey setting and tone. The types of animals and how they differ from the real world say something about the place.
- Provide small adventure hooks. Each of these animals have a gameable detail that players can interact with.

## d20 animals of the Southern Lands

<div data-table-marker="animals"></div>

| d20 | Animal      | Detail
|-----|-------------|----------------------
| 1   | Ox          | Oxen are not owned, but hired to perform the skilled work of plowing a field. Small herds of oxen travel between villages plying their trade.
| 2   | Chicken     | Rogue spirits are often exorcised into a chicken. Still-moving whole-roasted devil-chicken is a special delicacy at grand feasts.
| 3   | Duck        | Always know the direction of due north. Often carried by navigators.
| 4   | Carp        | Guard river crossings and extort coins (which they hoard) in exchange for safe passage. Will destroy bridges to keep their protection racket going.
| 5   | Horse       | All horses in the Southern Lands trace their ancestry back to a single horse king. The value of a horse is based on the purity of it's bloodline.
| 6   | Monkey      | A common sight in towns and cities. Have a knack for picking locks and are often employed by thieves.
| 7   | Crocodile   | Intelligent, scheming and evil. Can imitate human voices to draw children close to the water.
| 8   | Ape         | Warlords of the woods. Hunt deer, crocodile and each other with stone clubs and spears. Travelers are wise to keep well away from the apelands.
| 9   | Deer        | Bone white fur. A stag's antlers glow when danger is near, even after the stag is dead.
| 10  | Eagle       | Lords of the high mountains. Do not die from old age, and never stop growing. Duels of honour are the main cause of death.
| 11  | Raven       | Can speak with the dead they consume. If you feed a raven a dead person's eye, it will caw out a single word â€” the last thing the person saw.
| 12  | Frog        | The timing of a frogs croaking is very precise. Those that learn the patterns can tell the time of day down to the minute.
| 13  | Crab        | Must constantly eat iron to replenish their metallic shells, which would otherwise rust away. More than one army has woken to a parade of crabs devouring their armoury.
| 14  | Snake       | Highly magical. Snake blood is prized by wizards, who drink it to maintain their powers.
| 15  | Eel         | Are snakes that were born underwater. They cannot reproduce, so steal snake eggs and raise them as their own. Eel blood is highly poisonous, but looks and smells identical to snake blood.
| 16  | Fox         | Can shape-shift into human form. Still has the nature and intelligence of a fox, so cannot hide for long.
| 17  | Dog         | Southern Lands guard dogs are prized for their ability to smell lies. A well trained Southern Mastif can smell the traces of deception up to an hour after it occurred.
| 18  | Cat         | Have a secretive, highly complex legal code by which all other creatures are judged. A cat lawyer is required to argue your case in front of the court.
| 19  | Bat         | The backs of bat wings bend light around them. A sleeping bat looks like a broken pane of glass.
| 20  | Crane       | There is only one crane, the lonely queen. She is many places at once, but never with a mate. Many men have tried to court her, but all have been found lacking.

I've started working on a game and setting called Mausritter. The player characters are cute mice, who are also classic D&D adventurers. It's a collection of a lot of the D&D ideas I've been collecting for a long time. It'll be packaged into a nice, compact little book, with plenty of random tables to help GMs run mouse-scale adventures.

This is part of the tables from Mausritter â€” d66 one-line adventure seeds, or 3d66 sometimes-nonsensical adventure seeds.

<table-roller table="adventure-seeds" buttons='[
["Random adventure", {
    "Creature": "Creature",
    "Problem": "Problem",
    "Complication": "Complication"
}],
["Very random adventure", {
    "Creature": "d36:Creature",
    "Problem": "d36:Problem",
    "Complication": "d36:Complication"
}]
]'></table-roller>

This is the fourth and (for now) final part of my planned [Gloaming Lands](/tags/gloaming-lands/) series. It intends to tie the proceeding [Settlements](/2018-12-10-settlements/) and [Gods](/2018-12-12-gods/) articles together and provide rules to quickly map out a point crawl for a region of the Gloaming Lands.

I've been quietly working away on a new collection of adventures for Mausritter, and I'm excited to able finally bring that to Kickstarter! It launched today along with a reprint of the Box Set (with new cover designs!).

The adventures in this are really special. It was a great opportunity to work with a lot of fantastic creators, and it's really cool to see what other people bring to the world of Mausritter! I'm looking forward to going into more detail on these soon.
